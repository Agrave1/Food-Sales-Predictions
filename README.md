## Data

8523 observations
## Methods
Dropped item identifier and outlet identifier columns in final analysis because each value in those columns was unique, ultimately adding nothing relevant to the analysis  
Imputed values based on frequency for categorical columns because the most frequent value would skew the data less  
Imputed values based on mean for numerical columns because there were no large outliers effecting the data
